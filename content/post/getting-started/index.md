## Overview

ERSP is a year-long research apprenticeship program designed to support students in their first research experience. The program seeks to give students, particularly those who are traditionally under-served in computing the foundational knowledge and skills for engaging in research in the discipline. Students work in a team (of typically four peers) with a faculty on a project related to computing that ties into the faculty's research area.
