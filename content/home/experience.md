    description: |2-
      Designed and developed constraint solver-based resource manager for Meta's AI/ML application pipelines to improve cluster utilization 
      * Showcased efficiency of resource manager by minimizing applications moved to only 10% while successfully improving utilization across geo-distributed clusters
      * Also designed coordination of independent schedulers to work together across different parts of the infrastructure


  - title: Returning Research Intern
    company: Oracle

    description: |2-
      Worked on improving FAAS cloud infrastructure utilization using multi-tenancy 
      * Extended cloud infrastructure processes to be multi-tenant, while introducing an acceptable trade-off with security and resource utilization
      * Reduced cost of keeping idle, provisioned serverless machines by improving utilization proportionally to the (number of CPU cores used by multi-tenant clients)/(total number of CPU cores)

    description: |2-
      Worked on improving concurrency and cold start latency in FAAS runtime systems for multi-tenant cloud environments
      * Profiled the impact of shared memory for serverless runtimes with JVM based applications
      * Improved cold starts by 9-29%, and memory usage by 1.2x, against native applications in a multi-tenant cloud
